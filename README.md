# NetDesigner Woes 
Our fiber documentation software at work leaves less than to be desired. I wanted to create a visually pleasing, user-friendly app to keep track of our "woes" 

**Link to project:** TBD



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB and Node.js

I wanted to make so we wouldn't have to share an excel file via email. Or go to an editable excel. Excels are great we just use them for everything. 


## Issues 
- I am not a designer, I have to figure out how I want the data to be displayed once input.  
- Unsure on how to "edit" a document once it's made and sent to the database. I'll dig into some docs and ask for help. 

## Optimizations

- Utilized existing db and made a new collection. 
- Got some good practice with Bootstrap to make a this web app fully responsive. 

## Lessons Learned:

- Install nodemon --dev was a lifesaver whenever I made changes to my server.js! 
- Don't try to do too much at once. Always build a little, TEST, save and push my code. 

## Steps to set up a project:
